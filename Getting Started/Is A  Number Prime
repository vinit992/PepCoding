/*
1. You've to check whether a given number is prime or not.
2. Take a number "t" as input representing count of input numbers to be tested.
3. Take a number "n" as input "t" number of times.
4. For each input value of n, print "prime" if the number is prime and "not prime" otherwise.

Constraints
1 <= t <= 10000
2 <= n < 10^9

Format
Input
