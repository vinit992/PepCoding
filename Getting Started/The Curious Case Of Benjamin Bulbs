/*
1. You are given n number of bulbs. They are all switched off. A weird fluctuation in voltage hits the circuit n times. In the 1st fluctuation all bulbs are toggled, in the 2nd fluctuation every 2nd bulb is toggled, in the 3rd fluctuation every 3rd bulb is toggled and so on. You've to find which bulbs will be switched on after n fluctuations.
2. Take as input a number n, representing the number of bulbs.
3. Print all the bulbs that will be on after the nth fluctuation in voltage.

Constraints
2 <= n < 10^9

Format
Input
n, an integer

Output
b1 b2 b3 b4 .. all bulbs that will be on after nth wave

Example
Sample Input

6

Sample Output
1
4

 /*
 In Starting all the Bulbs are off after first fluctation all bulbs are on and second flucation even number of bulbs are on
 lets take an example to expalin much better 
 if n = 10 then 
 we have 
 1 ✔
 2 ✔ ✔
 3 ✔ ✔
 4 ✔ ✔ ✔
 5 ✔ ✔ 
 6 ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ 
 7 ✔ ✔
 8 ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔
 9 ✔ ✔ ✔
 10 ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔
 here right click(✔) shows on bulbs
 and we can identify here
 which number contains even number of right click(✔) its off after complete the flucations
 and which number has odd number of right click(✔) then its on after complete all the flucations
 and we also identify one more which number has perfect square then its the bulb is on here 1, 4, 9 are perfect square has contains odd numbers of odd click means its on
 and others are off after complete flucations.
